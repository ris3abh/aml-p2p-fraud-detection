# AML P2P Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a state-of-the-art suspicious activity detection system for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, addressing the critical challenge of money laundering detection in digital payment systems. Using the PaySim synthetic dataset, we tackle extreme class imbalance (1:773 fraud ratio) while building a production-ready ML system that balances high fraud detection rates with manageable false positive volumes.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions detect only 2% of the $800B-$2T laundered globally each year. This system aims to:
- Maximize suspicious activity detection (target: 85-95% recall)
- Reduce false positive rates by 60-75% compared to rule-based systems
- Provide explainable risk scores for regulatory compliance
- Optimize analyst resources with intelligent alert prioritization

## Technical Highlights
- **Extreme Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE-ENN, cost-sensitive learning, and threshold optimization
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 500+ features including velocity, network graph, temporal, and behavioral patterns
- **Ensemble Architecture**: Stacking ensemble with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Graph Neural Networks
- **Production MLOps**: Real-time inference (<100ms), drift detection, and champion-challenger framework
- **Regulatory Compliance**: SHAP explainability, fairness metrics, and SR 11-7 documentation

## Dataset
- **Source**: PaySim synthetic mobile money dataset (6.36M transactions)
- **Time Period**: 744 hours (~30 days)
- **Fraud Rate**: 0.13% (8,213 fraud cases out of 6.36M)
- **Key Constraint**: Balance columns excluded to prevent label leakage
