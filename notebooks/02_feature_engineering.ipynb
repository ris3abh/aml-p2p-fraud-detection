    "## Feature Engineering: Clean Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "After discovering the balance column leakage, we're rebuilding from scratch using only legitimate features derived from transaction amount, type, and timing. This constraint forces us to be creative but ensures our model learns actual fraud patterns rather than data artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The cyclical encoding (sin/cos transformations) preserves the circular nature of time - hour 23 is close to hour 0, not far from it. This is crucial for capturing the fraud concentration around hours 3-6 AM that we discovered in EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key temporal flags:\n",
    "- `is_fraud_peak_hour` (3-6 AM): Directly targets the 146x fraud concentration\n",
    "- `is_night` (10 PM - 6 AM): Broader overnight pattern  \n",
    "- `is_business_hours` (9 AM - 5 PM): When legitimate activity dominates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amount-Based Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can't use balance ratios, we focus on amount patterns:\n",
    "- **Log transformation**: Handles the extreme range ($0 to $92M)\n",
    "- **Z-score by type**: Normalizes amounts within each transaction type using only training statistics to avoid leakage\n",
    "- **High amount flags**: $1M+ threshold catches the fraud preference for large transactions\n",
    "- **Round number detection**: Although PaySim didn't show real structuring behavior, these are standard AML red flags\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavioral Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction type proved to be our strongest signal:\n",
    "- `is_risky_type`: Captures TRANSFER and CASH_OUT (the only types with fraud)\n",
    "- Individual type flags for granular modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Interactions - The Secret Sauce\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction features multiply different risk factors, creating powerful compound signals:\n",
    "- `risky_type_fraud_hour`: TRANSFER/CASH_OUT × peak hours = **681x lift** (!)\n",
    "- `risky_type_high_amount`: Risky types with high amounts\n",
    "- `high_amount_night`: Large transactions at unusual hours\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The lift ratios confirm our feature engineering success:\n",
    "- **681x lift** from the type×hour interaction validates that fraud is highly concentrated in specific patterns\n",
    "- **146x lift** from fraud peak hours alone\n",
    "- **70x lift** from round thousands (despite low volume)\n",
    "- **16x lift** from high amounts\n",
    "\n",
    "These extreme lift ratios, while partly due to PaySim's simplistic fraud patterns, give us strong signals to work with despite the 1:774 class imbalance."

    "\n",
    "We've assembled 24 features from our clean engineering process, carefully excluding all balance-related columns and potential sources of leakage. The one-hot encoding of transaction types adds 5 binary features, giving us a total feature space that's manageable yet expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signal Strength Analysis - The Moment of Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature rankings reveal something remarkable about our engineering choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The interaction term dominates everything else:**\n",
    "- `risky_type_fraud_hour` achieves an astounding 681x lift ratio\n",
    "- This single feature captures the compound pattern: risky transaction types (TRANSFER/CASH_OUT) occurring during fraud peak hours (3-6 AM)\n",
    "- To put this in perspective: while fraud base rate is 0.13%, transactions with this feature have an 88% fraud rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-score normalization pays off:**\n",
    "- `amount_zscore_by_type` (653x lift) shows that normalizing amounts within transaction types was crucial\n",
    "- Raw amount only achieves 8.2x lift, but the normalized version jumps to 653x\n",
    "- This suggests fraud amounts are extreme outliers within their transaction type context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal features validate our EDA findings:**\n",
    "- `is_fraud_peak_hour` alone provides 146x lift\n",
    "- Combined with other risk factors in interaction terms, the signal strengthens dramatically\n",
    "\n",
    "These lift ratios are suspiciously high for real-world fraud detection. In production systems, we rarely see features with >10x lift, let alone 681x. This reinforces our earlier observation that PaySim's fraud generation is overly simplistic - real fraudsters don't concentrate 100% of their activity at specific hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we'll work with what we have. The model should easily achieve strong performance on this dataset, but we must remember these patterns won't transfer to real-world fraud detection where adversaries actively try to blend in with normal behavior."

    "### Baseline Model Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Our XGBoost baseline with cost-sensitive learning (`scale_pos_weight=974`) provides a solid starting point, achieving reasonable discrimination (AUPRC 0.341, AUC-ROC 0.893) despite the extreme class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Threshold Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost-optimized threshold (0.001) reveals a critical issue:\n",
    "- **100% recall achieved** - we catch every single fraud\n",
    "- **But at what cost?** - We're flagging 68,117 transactions (42% of the test set!)\n",
    "- **SAR conversion: 2.7%** - Well below industry benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates a fundamental challenge in fraud detection: mathematically optimal thresholds often aren't operationally feasible. No financial institution can investigate 42% of their transactions - analyst teams would be overwhelmed, customer experience would suffer, and operational costs would explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model discrimination is strong:**\n",
    "- AUPRC 0.341 is 30x better than random (0.0114 baseline)\n",
    "- Train/test ratio of 1.4x shows good generalization despite 11x concept drift\n",
    "- The model successfully learned our engineered features\n",
    "\n",
    "**But business metrics reveal the problem:**\n",
    "- 2.7% SAR conversion vs 5-10% basic ML benchmark\n",
    "- We're generating 36 false alerts for every true fraud\n",
    "- $331,315 in costs (mostly from 66,263 false positives × $5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Path Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "This baseline demonstrates we need to:\n",
    "1. **Apply business constraints** - Cap alerts at realistic 1-5% of transactions\n",
    "2. **Improve the model** - Try CatBoost, ensemble methods\n",
    "3. **Calibrate probabilities** - Current scores cluster near 0, making threshold selection difficult\n",
    "4. **Consider alternative metrics** - Optimize for SAR conversion within alert budget rather than pure cost minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news: we have a working model with no data leakage. Now we need to make it practical for production use."
